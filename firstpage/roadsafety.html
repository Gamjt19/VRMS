   <center><h3>About Road Safety</h3></center>
   <p>Road safety is an essential aspect of our daily lives, ensuring the protection of drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. With the increasing number of vehicles on the road, following traffic rules and adopting responsible driving habits are more important than ever.</p>
   <center><h3>Indian Traffic Sign</h3></center>
   <p>The dataset contains over 9000+ images of 70 different traffic signs found in Indian metropolitan regions, captured in various settings and lightening conditions.</p>
   <center><h4>Key Traffic Rules in India</h4></center>
   <p>Traffic rules in India are designed to ensure road safety, smooth traffic flow, and prevent accidents. Governed by the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, these regulations mandate adherence to speed limits, wearing helmets and seat belts, avoiding drunk driving, and following traffic signals. Using mobile phones while driving, triple riding on two-wheelers, and reckless overtaking are punishable offenses. Pedestrians have the right of way at zebra crossings, and emergency vehicles must always be given priority. Vehicle owners must carry valid documents such as a driving license, registration certificate (RC), insurance, and pollution under control (PUC) certificate. Parking violations, unnecessary honking, and underage driving also attract fines and penalties. By following these rules, individuals contribute to a safer and more organized road environment, reducing traffic congestion and minimizing road mishaps.</p>
